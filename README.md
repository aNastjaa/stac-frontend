## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### 1. **API Call Failures**
   - **Issue**: Your React app is unable to make successful API requests to the Laravel backend.
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Incorrect API URL or endpoint.
     - Missing or incorrect CSRF token.
     - Network issues or server not responding.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Ensure that the correct API URL is set in your `.env` file (`VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`).
     - Verify that the backend is running and the API endpoint is correct.
     - Check the browser console for error messages related to CORS or network errors. If you see CORS errors, ensure the backend is properly configured for cross-origin requests.
     - Use the `setCsrfCookie` function to ensure the CSRF token is set before making requests.

### 2. **CSRF Token Errors**
   - **Issue**: Receiving a `403 Forbidden` or similar error due to CSRF token issues.
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - CSRF token is not properly set or retrieved from cookies.
     - The token is not included in the request headers.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Make sure to call `setCsrfCookie` on page load to set the CSRF token before making any authenticated API requests.
     - Use the `getCsrfTokenFromCookie` function to retrieve and attach the CSRF token to your requests in headers.

### 3. **Authentication Errors**
   - **Issue**: Authentication is not working, and users are unable to log in or remain logged in.
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Authentication token is not properly stored or retrieved from `localStorage`.
     - The token is expired or invalid.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Check if the authentication token is properly stored in `localStorage` and is retrieved correctly using `getAuthToken`.
     - Ensure the backend returns a valid token and that your frontend is sending the correct token with each request.

### 4. **State Management Issues**
   - **Issue**: React components are not updating or rendering as expected.
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Incorrect usage of `useState`, `useEffect`, or `context` leading to stale or missing state updates.
     - Props not passed correctly, or state not being updated when expected.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Ensure that state updates are done correctly in your components, particularly when interacting with APIs. Use the proper state setter function to update the component state after an API response.
     - Double-check that props passed to components are correctly set and that your components properly handle changes in state.

### 5. **UI/UX Issues**
   - **Issue**: Layout or UI components not displaying correctly.
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - CSS styles not applied correctly or conflicting styles causing issues.
     - Missing dependencies for UI libraries (e.g., Lucide icons, styled-components).
   - **Solutions**:
     - Inspect the layout and styles using browser dev tools to check for missing or conflicting CSS styles.
     - Make sure all necessary dependencies are installed and correctly imported in your project.
     - Test the app in different browsers to ensure compatibility.

### 6. **Component Errors (e.g., `FullScreenPost` or `CommentSection`)**
   - **Issue**: Components are rendering blank, throwing errors, or failing to function as expected.
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Missing or incorrect props.
     - Errors in API calls made inside components.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Ensure that all required props are passed down to your components, especially for components like `FullScreenPost` or `CommentSection`.
     - Add error handling to API requests to prevent the UI from breaking when there‚Äôs a failed request.
     - If your component uses external data, ensure that the data is properly fetched and passed to the component before it renders.

### 7. **File Upload Issues**
   - **Issue**: Files (e.g., images or submissions) are not uploading correctly to the backend.
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Incorrect API endpoint for file uploads.
     - Missing or incorrect headers in the file upload request.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Double-check the file upload endpoint and ensure it matches the Laravel backend configuration.
     - Verify that the correct `Content-Type` and other necessary headers are set in the request when uploading files.
     - Ensure that the backend properly handles the file upload and returns the correct response.

### 8. **Authentication with Sanctum**
   - **Issue**: The application is not maintaining the authenticated state across page reloads or after logging out.
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Auth token is not stored or cleared correctly in `localStorage` or cookies.
     - Backend session or token handling issues.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Ensure that after logging in, the authentication token is saved in `localStorage` and correctly retrieved during subsequent API calls.
     - When logging out, make sure to remove the token from `localStorage` to prevent unauthorized access.
